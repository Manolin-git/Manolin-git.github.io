        I am a physicist broadly interested in the ideas at the intersection between condensed matter theory, quantum computing, and information theory.
        A significant fraction of my research is naturally devoted to the development and use of quantum algorithms and simulations.
        I'm also interested in studying quantum information scrambling in many-body systems.
