In a interview, John Williams says of Stoner: 
<blockquote>
A lot of people who have read the novel think that stoner had such a sad and bad life. I think he had a very good life. He had a better life than most people do, certainly.
</blockquote>
And although, it's true, in the sense of 'he did what he wanted to', but it did not bring him level of content that he wished for 
<blockquote>
<p>He had wanted friendship and the closeness of friendship that might hold him in the race of mankind; he had had two friends, one of whom had died senselessly before he was known, the other of whom had now withdrawn so distantly into the ranks of the living that . . . He had wanted the singleness and the still connective passion of marriage; he had had that, too, and he had not known what to do with it, and it had died. He had wanted love; and he had had love, and had relinquished it, had let it go into the chaos of potentiality. Katherine, he thought. "Katherine."</p>

<p>And he had wanted to be a teacher, and he had become one; yet he knew, he had always known, that for most of his life he had been an indifferent one. He had dreamed of a kind of integrity, of a kind of purity that was entire; he had found compromise and the assaulting diversion of triviality. He had conceived wisdom, and at the end of the long years he had found ignorance. And what else? he thought. What else?</p>
</blockquote>
And I, myself, like many others perhaps, find the last moment to be particularly forlorn. But there are others too, and mostly the life of Grace is downcasting, ruined by dispute between Stoner and his wife.
<blockquote>
<p>"Edith," Stoner said. "Wait. You're taking too much for granted. Perhaps Grace and this young man don't want to get married. We need to talk it out with Grace."</p>

<p>"What's there to talk about? Of course they'll want to get married. After all, they--they-- Gracie, tell your father. Explain to him."</p>

<p>Grace said to him, "It doesn't matter, Father. It doesn't matter at all."</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
And Stoner came to realize that she was, as she had said, almost happy with her despair; she would live her days out quietly, drinking a little more, year by year, numbing herself against the nothingness her life had become.
</blockquote>



<!-- 'Stoner' often thought to be a sad and tragic life of a man, however, it is an ordinary life and in fact a good one. Stoner's life had had it's up and down like anyother, and he learned through them and kept faith in himself. Though, it's naturalness should also not deter us from it's sad and tragic part, those are ordinary too for they are part of all stories --- but sad nonethless. 

Stoner's life have many chapters, summarized through --- 


Stoner longed for a closeness that might have offered his a sense of belonging and purpose amid life's hardships, but his desire remained mostly unfulfilled. He had had two friends --- Dave Masters, who "died senselessly" before their friendship could fully develop, and Gordan Flinch, who's friendship faded over time --
<blockquote>
Gordon smiled and nodded and made a joke; but Stoner knew that in that instant Gordon Finch had withdrawn from him in such a way that he could never return. He felt a keen regret that he had spoken so of Dave Masters, the defiant boy they both had loved, whose ghost had held them, all these years, in a friendship whose depth they had never quite realized.
</blockquote>
He falls in love with an idealized woman and slowly and bitterly realized of its failure ---
<blockquote>
Within a month he knew that his marriage was a failure; within a year he stopped hoping that it would improve. He learned silence and did not insist upon his love.
</blockquote>
but the marriage did bring love to him in the form of his daughter "he began to know how centrally important Grace had become to his existence.", though soon their gentle, pliable daughter becomes the wife's chosen battleground
<blockquote>
He saw his daughter seldom now. The three of them took their meals together, but on these occasions he hardly dared to speak to her, for when he did, and when Grace answered him, Edith soon found something wanting in Grace's table manners, or in the way she sat in her chair, and she spoke so sharply that her daughter remained silent and downcast through the rest of the meal.
</blockquote>
and it didn't ended well for Grace, and it's perhaps sadest part of the novel ---
<blockquote>
<p>  "Edith," Stoner said. "Wait. You're taking too much for granted. Perhaps Grace and this young man don't want to get married. We need to talk it out with Grace."</p>

<p>  "What's there to talk about? Of course they'll want to get married. After all, they--they-- Gracie, tell your father. Explain to him."</p>

<p>  Grace said to him, "It doesn't matter, Father. It doesn't matter at all." </p>

<p>  And it didn't matter, Stoner realized; Grace's eyes were fixed beyond him, into a distance she could not see and which she contemplated without curiosity. He remained silent and let his wife and daughter make their plans. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  They talked late into the night, as if they were old friends. And Stoner came to realize that she was, as she had said, almost happy with her despair; she would live her days out quietly, drinking a little more, year by year, numbing herself against the nothingness her life had become. He was glad she had that, at least; he was grateful that she could drink.
</blockquote>
Outside the marriage, Stonerâ€™s affair with a young teacher become entwined in bitter, vindictive university policies, though he learned something ---
<blockquote>
In his forty-third year William Stoner learned what others, much younger, had learned before him: that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another.
</blockquote>
and through this love, he learned, "Lust and learning," Katherine once said. "That's really all there is, isn't it?" And they were happy for their rented time. -->
