My research focus on two themes (sometime on the intersection) : <br>

*Quantum information scrambling:*  mixing up qubits so that they become entangled
and intertwined, creating a complex mess. The quantity called Krylov complexity
(K-complexity) quantifies how quantum information scrambles. We study and characterize the behavior of K-complexity in various systems.<br>


*Quantum algorithms & simulations:*  <br>
