My research is based on two broad areas ---

1. Quantum scrambling
2. Quantum-simulation & Quantum algorithms

& sometimes on their intersection.

<h2>Quantum Scrambling</h2>

We study how the many-body interactions lead to scrambling of initially localized information.

<h2>Quantum walks</h2>

We use quantum-walks to develop quantum algorithms and simulations.
