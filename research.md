My research focus on two themes (sometime on the intersection) : Quantum information scrambling and Quantum algorithms & simulations <br>

<!-- mixing up qubits so that they become entangled
and intertwined, creating a complex mess. The quantity called Krylov complexity
(K-complexity) quantifies how quantum information scrambles. We study and characterize the behavior of K-complexity in various systems.<br> -->
