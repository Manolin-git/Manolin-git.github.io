Hi there! 

This is my personal website. 

I am a PhD student at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, supervised by [Sisi Zhou](https://sisi-zhou.github.io/). I obtained my MS research degree in physics from Indian Institute of Science in 2024, under guidance of [CM Chandrashekar](http://iap.iisc.ac.in/~chandracm/). My thesis title is <i>“Quantum-walk based algorithms & simulations”</i>.

I am a physicist broadly interested in the ideas at the intersection between condensed matter theory, quantum computing, and information theory.
