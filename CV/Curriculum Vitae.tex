		\textbf{Summary:} Our work extended the Krylov construction framework to dissipative open quantum systems coupled to a Markovian bath. This approach accommodates non-Hermitian effects due to the environment. Our investigation of the dissipative transverse-field Ising model and dissipative interacting XXZ chain reveals that initial Lanczos coefficients distinguish integrable and chaotic evolution during weak coupling. As dissipative effects intensify, higher Lanczos coefficients exhibit heightened fluctuations, culminating in similar late-time complexity saturation for both integrable and chaotic scenarios, casting doubt on the concept of late-time chaos.}

		\textbf{Team/Collaborators:} Dr. Ahmadullah Zahed (ICTP, Trieste)\\
		\textbf{Summary:} We studied circuit complexity of quantum walk. Notably, we unveil that the Nielson complexity during unitary evolution oscillates, centering around an average circuit depth. Additionally, we reveal that the complexity of the step-wise evolution operator exhibits cumulative and linear growth in relation to the number of steps taken. This observation, from a quantum circuit perspective, implies a sequential application of (approximately) constant-depth circuits, contributing to the attainment of the final state. We explicitly constructed the quantum circuit, and verified the observation. This study contribute to our understanding of relation between quantum complexity and circuit complexity.}

		\textbf{Team/Collaborators:} Kshitij Vijay Sharma (Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science) \\ \textbf{Summary:} In ongoing work, we studied OTOC as well as complex level-spacing ratio as a diagnose of quantum chaos for the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum kicked rotor -- a textbook driven chaotic system. The analysis based on complex level-spacing ratio shows that phase space consists of unbroken integrable and chaotic phases, and broken chaotic phase while broken integrable phase is absent. The OTOC shows exponential growth at early time in chaotic phase, as well as at late time in broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phase.} 
	
	\cventry{07/2023-10/2023}{Quantum search algorithm}{}{}{}{\textbf{PI:} Dr. Kallol Sen (ICTP-South American Instutute of Fundamental Research)\\ \textbf{Summary:} Building upon the quantum search algorithms, we have extended their applicability to a diverse range of problems spanning multiple fields, such as real-time object tracking, network management, and routing. Our approach involves expanding the database by introducing an additional dimension, similar to error-correction codes, which provides supplementary information, including the category of the search data points. We have applied this method to develop an algorithm for tracking moving particles, but its potential reaches far beyond this specific problem.}

We find that the non-locality results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. The corresponding Krylov complexities  still carry the distinguishability between integrable and chaotic theories in a suppressed way than the local Hamiltonian, which is a result of the faster scrambling for nonlocal Hamiltonian at early times. We investigate behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as a probe of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local interactions.}

	%Iâ€™ll pursue my research internship in quantum computation and information due to its interdisciplinary approach as it brings together ideas from information theory, computer science, and quantum physics, and its wide applicability from understanding fundamental physics to applications in cryptography, communication, and many others. Thereâ€™s also a wide possibility of close collaboration between experiments, theory, and industry. Pursuing my research internship in physics at OIST will provide me with the rigorous training needed to develop my theoretical skills and conduct independent research. It would further add to my research journey toward Ph.D. in the same field.

	%Over the past several years, I have been fortunate to have opportunities to conduct challenging projects in physics, through which I developed my interest in quantum computing. "But imagination alone is not enough because the reality of nature is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine." This quote from the TV series "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey" resonated deeply, igniting a burning desire to learn more about the cosmos and contribute to our understanding. Inspired by the series, which introduced me to a vast array of natural phenomena, the history of civilization, and the individuals who expanded our knowledge of the world, I became determined to join the ranks of those unravelling the mysteries of nature. This passion, coupled with my status as an Inspire scholar, led me to pursue a bachelorâ€™s degree in physics.
	%
	%During my undergraduate years, Quantum physics captivated me the most due to its contrasting nature with classical physics and its potential for unifying various branches of the field. Lectures by Balakrishnan provided me with invaluable mathematical rigor, while authors like R. Shankar, Steven H. Simon, and Purcell revealed the simplicity at the core of this captivating subject. I also took part in discussion in platform such as Physics stack exchange which gave me strong ground of basic concepts. I decided to pursue carrier in research and joined Indian Institute of Science as masterâ€™s student. 
	%
	%During the summer of 2022, I did three projects in various fields ranging from many-body system to quantum computation to high-energy physics. Some of these projects followed in my later semester projects. Here, Iâ€™ll describe few of these which added to my interest in quantum computation and information.
	%
	%As my first project, I worked with a Postdoc, Aranya, assigned to me as a guide by Prof. Aninda Sinha on quantum information scrambling (QIS), which can be thought of as mixing up qubits in way that they become entangled and intertwined with each other, creating a complex mess. The quantity called Krylov complexity quantifies how quantum information scrambles. The project focuses on extension of current formulation to study quantum information scrambling in dissipative quantum systems where information can flow to environment. In this project, my role was to independently study the system, thereby confirming the results obtained by collaborators. The results were later reported in JHEP as equally contributed author. The project was numerically intense, which made me accustomed to coding (language such as python). I also gained familiarity with various libraries such as Numpy, Scipy, Quspin, etc. 
	%
	%In the coming months, we explored Krylov complexity in various settings. For example, we considered QIS in PT-symmetric systems which can be thought of as system that interact with environment in a way that thereâ€™s a balance between the energy exchange. We are keeping this idea back of our mind, waiting for right idea to pop up. The study of PT-symmetric system come handy in my other projects as I discuss later.
	%
	%In early 2023, as a continuation to our previous work, we showed that Krylov complexity follows a universal behaviour in open quantum systems. In this project, I did numerical calculation of Krylov complexity for several models. I also did analytical calculation in support of numerical observation. These analytics require solving wave-functions that follow certain recurrence relation among themselves. I took a continuum limit over index of wave-function and constructed a partial differential equation. This PDE can be solved analytically in certain case. This taught me that numerical calculation are a good playground to verify your physical intuition in cases where the analytical calculation is complex. This work is reported and in review process (the last referee report is in positive). This works also added to my skills in working with others. Furthermore, since, the work is mainly with student at Ph.D. and Postdoc level, I able to immerse myself more in discussions.

	%As my second project, I worked with Prof. C M Chandrashekar on quantum simulation based on the quantum walks. It started as self-structured survey of which I was in charge after which I settled to a problem of simulating neutrino oscillation. Neutrinos are nearly massless particles that are produced in various processes like nuclear reactions in the Sun and come in three different â€˜flavorsâ€™: electron, muon, and tau. Neutrino oscillation happens because donâ€™t stay in just one flavor. As they move through space, they can change from one flavor to another. I started to reproduce results from earlier literature, which took time. This is partially because most of the time literature do not provide details of worked out results, and sometime even the parameter values are missing. Therefore, I have refigured out these which in turn gave me a clear understanding of the work. During the literature survey, I always used to look for what can be improved in the approach which came handy in this paper. I realized that if you want to simulate neutrino dynamics with quantum walk the number of qubits required increase linearly as time. The linearly increasing qubit space comes from position space of particle. To overcome this problem, I propose a formulation that eliminate the requirement of position space by reconciling the effect of position space through introduction of additional operators. The work later reported and submitted for review. The work added to my understanding of simulating fundamental physics with quantum simulators, and furthermore, gained insight into independent research.
	%
	%As my masterâ€™s thesis, I decided to pursue quantum computation \& information in framework of quantum-walks due to its interdisciplinary approach that appeals to me. I again embarked into a self-structured literature survey and looked wide range of topics such as quantum memories for quantum repeaters, a device essential for exchange of quantum information over long distances. Iâ€™m trying to exploit recurrence theorem in quantum walk to devise quantum memory. According to recurrence theorem, the quantum state of a system repeat itself after certain time. However, previous studies have shown that theorem doesnâ€™t hold in generic quantum walks. I devised a quantum walk formulation that revive the recurrence property which involve adding a periodic time dependence in system parameter. Currently, Iâ€™m looking into analytics of this formulation to provide expression for recurrence time. 
	%
	%Apart from this, I'm also looking into the quantum percolation model, which is used to study the behaviour of quantum particles, such as electrons or photons, in a disordered medium. In previous work, quantum simulation based on the quantum walk of such a model has been proposed. I'm trying to extend this to study transport in PT- symmetric disorder systems. We expect this to give a robust PT- symmetric phase that can support an Anderson localization transition, offering a rich phase diagram due to the interplay between disorder and PT- symmetry.
	%
	%Due to my wide collaboration interest, I joined Postdoc Kallol in a project that explores the interconnection between quantum complexity and circuit complexity. In Nielsen's geometric formulation, the circuit complexity of a unitary operator $U$ is the length of the minimal geodesic on the unitary ground joining the identity to $U$. The relation between this circuit complexity and circuit depth in actual quantum circuits is still not explored. In the coming months, we explored this problem by considering an example of quantum walk. We did explicit calculations of both the complexities and showed that both the complexities grow linear over time. I did explicit calculation of circuit complexity of quantum circuit as well as numerical investigation of neilsen complexity. We reported these results, which are currently under review. 
	%
	%In the realm of quantum computing, the quantum walk search algorithm is designed for locating fixed marked nodes within a graph. However, when multiple marked nodes exist, this conventional search method lacks the capacity to reveal their order. I proposed modification to search algorithm that overcome this problem. Leveraging this concept, we tackle the problem of tracking a moving particle in both space and time. Our algorithm efficiently searches for the trajectory of the mobile particle and is supported by a proposed quantum circuit. This concept holds promise for a range of applications, from real-time object tracking to network management and routing. The project taught me a lot about quantum algorithms, and quantum circuit construction for these. At the end, I also used to using libraries such as Qiskit. We are preparing an abstract for submission and a manuscript for publication.

	%I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to pursue searches of new physics at OIST. OIST is at the frontier of both theoretical and experimental work in this field, and I am drawn to its strong collaborative culture. I am interested in working with Prof. Kae Nemoto, Prof. David Elkouss and Prof. Thomas Busch. After careful inspection about work of these faculties, I am confident I would thrive under their mentorship and expertise. I believe I have the tools to conduct successful research as a member of these theoretical as well as experimental teams. With my skills, my interdisciplinary background, and my ability to learn independently, I will be able to provide new ideas as a productive group member.
	%
	%My previous experiences have allowed me to develop as a researcher: independent and able to work collaboratively towards a common goal. I look forward to further learning, challenging myself, and developing new skills, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to continue my interdisciplinary research and academic journey at OIST.
