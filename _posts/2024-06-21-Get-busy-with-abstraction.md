'The Plague' maybe the best descriptiion of our situation during the time of Covid-19.

 Whether it comes to reaction from officials
<blockquote>
Please answer me quite frankly. Are you absolutely convinced itâ€™s plague?
</blockquote>
or reaction of general populus
<blockquote>
So they went on strolling about the town as usual and sitting at the tables on cafe terraces. Generally speaking, they did not lack courage, bandied more jokes than lamentations, and made a show of accepting cheerfully unpleasantnesses that obviously could be only passing.
</blockquote>
All in all, it tries to make you confront with an immediate possibility of your death. The characters have their own different ideas about things -- like Life, God, and stuff. And a lot of talks in the midst of the plague which I really enjoyed. 
<blockquote>
"Do you believe in God, doctor?" <br>

"No? but what does that really mean?"
</blockquote>
And it's full of ideas that I only somewhat understood but not completely. There's one, that mainly revolves around Rieux (also the narrator), is of <i>abstraction</i>. It comes at number of places throughout the novel and however, long conversation on it, still so much clear. 

It first comes during the conversation with Rambert, a visitor in the town. So Rambert want to get out of the town and live with his wife, since he don't have any business here. But because town is closed because of the  plague, he can't. He asks Rieux (who is a doctor) if he can give him a certificate that he don't have a plague. Rieux refuses since he can't be assured because he can get the plague after getting the certificate and besite it won't help him, anyways. On this Rambert says,
<blockquote>
"No," Rambert said bitterly, "you can't understand. You're using the language of reason, not of the heart; you live in a world of abstractions."
</blockquote>
So that gives the feeling that abstraction has something to do with being reasonable or factual. but few lines later, the narrator writes,
<blockquote>
Yes, the journalist was right in refusing to be balked of happiness. But was he right in reproaching him, Rieux, with living in a world of abstraction? Could that term "abstraction" really apply to these days he spent in his hospital while the plague was battening on the town, raising its deathtoll to five hundred victims a week? Yes, an element of abstraction, of a divorce from reality, entered into such calamitites. Still when abstraction sets to killing you, you're got to get busy with it.
</blockquote>






<!-- Apart from this theme of confronting the possibility of ceasing to exist, there are other themes explored through five or six characters. One of the main theme that explored through the narrator (Rieux) on <i>abstraction</i> which I did not understood so well on the first read, but only after when I listned to 'The Partially Examined Life' that it started to make more sense. -->
