In recent decades, quantum computation has garnered increasing attention from a wide array of scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, computer science, and industry. Quantum computers are designed to surpass classical computers by leveraging quantum algorithms, and one of the significant challenges they tackle is searching large databases, which has extensive practical applications. Quantum search algorithms are a subset of these algorithms that harness quantum advantages to outperform classical search algorithms, and they have been implemented on various quantum computing platforms. <br>

Building upon these quantum algorithms, we have extended their applicability to a diverse range of problems spanning multiple fields, such as real-time object tracking, network management, and routing. Our approach involves expanding the database by introducing an additional dimension, similar to error-correction codes, which provides supplementary information, including the category of the search data points. We have applied this method to develop an algorithm for tracking moving particles, but its potential reaches far beyond this specific problem and warrants attention from a broad audience. We also present a quantum circuit for executing the proposed quantum algorithm, which is a vital component of our contribution.
