Today marks the end of IBM Research Summer Internship 24. 

<!-- Here's a little pretext for memory! -->

<!-- I joined IBM research in March 24 as an Extern and worked on 'de novo genome assembly' with IBM Quantum researcher Kalyan Dasgupta in collaboration with IIT Madras.

Throughout the internship, we participated in number of events and activities like bootcamp, Paper We Wrote, All hands, Inter-O-Duction, Science Slam, Movie time, and a lot more. At IBM Research, we visited by Jay, the VP of IBM Quantum, and Ismael, the VP of Quantum services and Data. 

All and all, it was a fulfilling experience --- knowing more about industrial research and a good break from academia :) -->

Be productive. Be Curious. Be an IBMer!
