Our paper titled ''<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-023-04222-8">Open system approach to neutrino oscillations in a quantum walk framework</a>' is officially published in the Quantum Information Processing (also available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.13923">arXiv</a>). <br>

In this study, we proposed qubit-efficient scheme for discrete-time quantum walk based simulations. The schemes treats the interaction between position and spin as effective open system dynamics on spin, therefore, substitute the need of position space with an environment.
