In recent years, I have spent a lot of my time with cats, and often envied the luxury they have -- for they are carefree and absentminded at times. Not to worry about things that we humans are occupied with throughout our lives. However, this has not deter me from thinking of many who have a difficult life and have to look for their survival day by day. Nevertheless, absurd you may think, this let me to wonder, if I could myself be a cat -- wondering around the floors of building, sleeping in many a balacony without any care.


Soon I realized, however much entertaining the idea may be, I can never be a cat, and not because I can not trasform myself to a cat which is also true, but also because of the familiarity they have to their universe. I looked at myself in a body not taller than water bottle, and I could see sleek and slender build with coat adorned in shades of fiery orange, variations ranging from pale apricot to deep rust. I didn't much thought -- for I felt dizzy, half awake and slept nearly all day. When I woke up, I streached myself, and strode half the night. I watched strange people walk by, I could see how they tall they were, I have to see up on the sky to catch glimps of their faces. This exercise later bored me and I ignored them completely but only at times when I was fed. I was full of energy and started to walk here and there, revise the path ways. In few days, the map of the place was in my head and I met many alike me, they were mostly harmless -- in times I even find them amusing in their behavior which always seem trivial to me. I could read their gestures that they used to express - high tail, erect ears, narrowed eyes, and many. But they does not mean much to me - I never cared to held high my tail to show that I was happy or secure. I stretched my legs, I see the sky and that's all I see. I spend my days watching how the dwindling of color turns day into night. Lying here, thinking, and days, weeks, and months passed.

Now, I started feel some irritation of my schedule - rising, meal, walk, nap, watching, walk, meal, sleep, and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday according to the same rhythm. And the day by day this struggle become more and more familiar. I could see that I can no longer go on with this mechanical life, and time couldn't carry me either. But watching my kind far the struggle I feel so deep, I did not understood why? I was on the roof, walking over the narrow boundary - a skill which I was master through my daily routine. I gaze toward the height above the ground, and stupid idea whether my legs could slip came to my mind. I did not entertain this idea for long, and walk along when I saw two of my kind arguing over something - it was argument over territory which I never understood. As I moved my leg forward, I didn't felt the earth - and I realize I was falling. As I hit the ground, I felt something moving over me - it was a cat - my cat. I felt hollow, exhaused, and still sleepy, but then I realized that I have deadline for the work, and invitation for 7 o'clock. I started to dress up, and while I dress up thought of my stupid idea of being a cat for one more time. And I realize that stupidity of the idea lies in asking for being a cat without asking for their understanding. And reminded me of the line

<blockquote>
If I were a tree amoung trees, a cat amoung animals, this life would have a meaning.
</blockquote>
I nodded to myself and went out.
