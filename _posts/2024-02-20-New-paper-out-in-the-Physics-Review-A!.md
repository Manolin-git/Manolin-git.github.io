My paper titled '<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.109.022223">Complexity for one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk circuits</a>' is officially published in the Physics Review A (also available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.13450">arXiv</a>). <br>

In this paper, we demonstrated the connection between the circuit depth and Nielsenâ€™s complexity.
