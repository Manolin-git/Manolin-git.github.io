Stoner tells the life of a William Stoner, his wanderings to becoming a lecturer and vindictive workplace politics, his infatuation with young woman, Edith and slow realization of its failure, affair with his colleagure Katherine, and his love and pursuit of literature. And, on its surface, Stoner's life seems to be falling through, desolate, and forlorn, and he himself doesn't refute it at times, "Dispassionately, reasonably, he contemplated the failure that his life must appear to be." But's it also a recount of the work one puts into life and relationship, Stoner's passion for the knowledge and love. Love is a central in Stoner, and not just romantic but also love of knowledge, work, and friendship --- "It's the love of the thing that's essential", says John Williams. And despite Stoner's failure in many
<blockquote>
<p>He had wanted friendship and the closeness of friendship that might hold him in the race of mankind; he had had two friends, one of whom had died senselessly before he was known, the other of whom had now withdrawn so distantly into the ranks of the living that . . .

Stoner's first love to Edith was an ideal one, "And you must get used to it. I love you, and I cannot imagine living without you." And he graudually realizes that, "Within a month he knew that his marriage was a failure." Later, Stoner directed his love to their daughter. Though soon enough, her life consumed by thier battlefield, so consumed that she never spring up.
<blockquote>
<p>They talked late into the night, as if they were old friends. And Stoner came to realize that she was, as she had said, almost happy with her despair; she would live her days out quietly,  drinking a little more, year by year, numbing herself against the nothingness her life had become. He was glad she had that, at least; he was grateful that she could drink.</p>
