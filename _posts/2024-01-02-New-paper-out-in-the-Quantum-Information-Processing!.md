Quantum simulation have applications in study of problems in various fields e.g., condensed-matter
physics, high-energy physics, atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and cosmology. Quantum simulation could be experimentally implemented in either using quantum computers or analog devices which require less control. In this research, we propose a efficient novel scheme for simulating neutrino oscillations using a quantum walk framework. Although, A framework to simulate neutrino oscillation with discrete-time quantum walks has been proposed in previous literature. In this work,

- We approach the problem from the open quantum system perspective by considering the walkerâ€™s evolution in the reduced coin space, thereby effectively treating the position space as environment.
- We establish a connection between the dynamics of reduced coin state and neutrino phenomenology, enabling one to fix the simulation parameters for a given neutrino experiment.
- The simulation scheme reduces the need for extended position space to simulate neutrino oscillations.
- The introduced framework can be adopted to other simulation protocols based on quantum walk.
